# Moku

> Deploying applications has historically been complex in LIT, and the strategy for deploying
> ruby applications in particular has never fully stabilized. Moku intends to address this
> by treating deployment more like a service that A&E offers, with a stable, opaque API.
> Developers should not need to know how their applications will be deployed, nor the intimate
> details of our environment. At the same time, they need to be able to deploy, rollback,
> restart, and debug their applications rapidly and on-demand.
>
> There is one caveat: Moku does not make your first deploy much easier; it does so
> for every one afterwards.
